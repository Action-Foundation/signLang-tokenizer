# Create the meta prompt to guide the model's behavior
meta_prompt = """
Please simplify the following sentence for Kenya Sign Language interpretation. Follow these rules:
1. Capitalize names that appear in the sentence.
2. Remove these stop words: ['is', 'too', 'been', 'does', 'shouldnt', 'dont', 'shan't', 'while', 'haven't', 'so', 'until', 'it's', 'during', 'nor', 'of', 'had', 'whom', 'any', 'they'].
3. Replace certain words with their specific values:
   - 'into' with 'in'
   - 'haven't', 'won't', 'wouldn't', 'didn't' with 'bado', 'no', 'zero', 'nothing'
   - 'until' with 'time what'
   - 'when' with 'time what'
   - 'through' with 'finish'
   - 'most' with 'a lot'
   - 'during' with 'time which'
   - 'you'd' with 'you'
   - 'further' with 'far'
   - 'are' with 'time'

4. If a sentence is continuous (e.g., 'I am going'), change it to present form (e.g., 'I go').
5. Identify if the sentence is a question, listing, or statement.
6. If the sentence is in the past, prepend 'past /'. If itâ€™s in the present or future, prepend 'present/'. Remove tense markers in the final output and only retain the present tense form.
7. Exclude occupations or titles like 'Miss,' 'Mrs.,' 'President' from the final output.
8. If the sentence contains a name of place, city, country, village, i.e., the name of places will always start with a capital letter, so keep it capitalized.
9. Ensure the sentence follows a subject-object-verb order.
